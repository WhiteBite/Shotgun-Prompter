Your task is to refactor the provided Python code.
Focus on:
1. Readability: Improve variable names, add comments where necessary, simplify complex logic.
2. Efficiency: Identify and optimize any performance bottlenecks if possible, without sacrificing clarity.
3. Pythonic Style: Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines and use common Python idioms.
4. Maintainability: Ensure the refactored code is easy to understand and modify.

Explain your changes briefly *after* providing the refactored code block.
If no refactoring is needed for a particular file or section, state that clearly.
Output the refactored code first, then your explanations.
